# VTD_XML
VTD-XML is the next generation XML parser/indexer/editor/slicer/assembler/xpath-engine that goes beyond DOM, SAX and PULL in performance, memory usage, and ease of use.

# Version 
2.13_2

# Release notes
2.13_2 fixes an important bug that is reported in a stackoverflow question. It is the reverse of EQ and NE expression in a binary expression evaluation. It also fixed bugs related to VTDGen's CDATA termination sequence detection. Everything else is identical with 2.13_1
