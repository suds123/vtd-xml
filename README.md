# VTD_XML
VTD-XML is the next generation XML parser/indexer/editor/slicer/assembler/xpath-engine that goes beyond DOM, SAX and PULL in performance, memory usage, and ease of use.

# Version 
2.13_3

# Release notes
2.13_3 fixed a bug in VTDGen and sets teh default LC depth to 5. Also it has a new intHash implementation that significantly reduces both performance and memory usage for XPath evaluation.
